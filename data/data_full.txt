Yeah, so let me show you around this dump. (sighs) I don’t know why they keep asking me to do this shit but here we go, another tour. Yay. Follow me. A what? A chochsky. What’s a choch? Okay, look at him and say the word choch and it will come together for you. So, stay away from him…let’s move on. What do you mean? Yeah, she’s a pick and roll type. Pick and roll? Yeah, she ah, (whispers) she digs deep, you know, pick, lick, stick and flick. You follow? (she gestures to her nose) (dawns on Mike) Oh! She, she– You got it honey. So sit behind her to avoid taking shots to the head on launch days. That’s terrible. You gotta see it to believe it honey. Greg? No. Management must really like you then. I don’t follow. Greggie is offie. All the men just simply decided to just let him have his own bathroom. All the guys use the one downstairs. Right. Speaking of which, let’s take the stairs. I’m not into elevators. Got caught in an elevator once for four hours with a dead guy. Dead guy? Friggin’ heart attack. While being stuck in an elevator? You betcha. Oh. Before we get to the next floor let me tell you about Marva. Did you meet– Marva I met, yeah. Okay, well don’t get drunk in front of her, EVER. She’s always on the prowl. She likes to go for after work drinky drinks and I swear this when I tell you at least three men have come back different. I think she’s a vampire.  They have never been the same since…you know. For real? Want to find out? No. There you go.  Remember the following; Vince is a druggie, Carlo smells like b.o., Misty is a bitch, Max is a tight wad, Hannah talks to birds. Ryan won’t be here much longer and you need to stop staring at my boobs. What?! I know my jugs are full but this ain’t gonna work if you keep hammering them home with your eyes, kid. I wasn’t! There, there. I like you. You’re a sweet boy. Just do your job, stay focused and keep your eyes where they belong and you will do great things here. I’m sorry, I really didn’t mean to— No harm taken. If you look straight ahead, that’s the cafeteria. Let’s go grab some coffee for the rest of your tour. When I pass through here’s. Why you always talkin’ shit on me for? Keep it movin’. Yo see? Now you sayin’ it to my face when you always sayin it behind my face? Why you do that for? Well now I’m sayin’ it to yo face. Why you do that? Leave me alone. Why you do that? Yo, chill son, just chill. Nobody wanna give problems. She call me dumb. Shut up, Dizz! Why you talk that way for? I ain’t afraid of you. I’m a stab you. I’ll smack you upside the head. Yo! Let’s chill! Yo man, nobody wants a problem. Just keep walking. The po-po just passed here. They be driving around the block. Gonna pass on through in a hot minute. I don’t care po-po. Piss on po-po. Say you sorry. Ha, ha, ha. Damn, Dizzia, just say you sorry. I ain’t about to apologize. Whatch you gonna do with that nail clipper? Cut you. You ain’t cuttin’ nobody. I’m sorry. What? I don’t mean to be mean on you. You makin’ fun of me so… Yeah, well, stop starin’ at people then. Ight man, we good, we good. I come back we friends? Friends? From now on? This boy is whack. Yeah, okay, we friendly, I don’t know about friends. Friendly is friends? Just, yeah man, we can be friends. Arright? You good now? Thanks.  No more bad talk.  Only good talk. Happy. Yo, nobody gonna say bad talk about you no more, playa. We good. Just don’t go pulling knives on people. Ight? Yeah. What the hell was that yo? He be starin’ at me all the time! Yo, we should report him. Nah, police already know about him though. Dizz, he pulled a blade on us. It’s all good. He wasn’t about to do nothin’.  He acts dangerous but he ain’t. He pulled a knife. I ain’t scared. I don’t need that dude rolling up on me. I got you. You ain’t got shit. Are you serious? Nah, man. That dude don’t think straight. Can I tell you something? Yeah. He’s my cousin. What you say? Cousin. That damn fool my cousin. He just don’t know he my cousin cause he too stupid. Are you kidding me? Why would I say it? How’s he yo cousin? On my dad’s side. My Uncle’s son. Oh snap. He ain’t even supposed to be out at this time. I can’t believe the neighborhood crazy is your cousin.  (beat)  I’m sorry. We good. He doesn’t recognize you as his cousin? Nah. I see him all the time but it don’t stick. Maybe that’s why he’s always starin’ at me when I see him in the street.  He can’t place me in his mind.  It frustrates him probably. Dag. Don’t tell anyone. I won’t say nothin’. I feel bad though. It’s all good. Ya own cousin pulled a knife on you. I mean, you should tell your Uncle then. Yeah. I don’t know. I tell him but he’s, he’s not good that way. He’s always beatin’ on him. On your cuz? Yeah, we even think my cousin got problems cause he took too many hits to the head when he was young. It’s a long story. What about your Auntie? My Auntie’s dead.  (beat) He harmless though. He ain’t ever hurt nobody before. I don’t know man. Let it be. It is what it is. Racist how? He was fat. What you sayin’ is you racist against fat people? get, what’s the damn word…repulsive. That it? I get repulsive? But ain’t you fat? So. Don’t you get repulsive to your own damn self? I do. Why don’t you punch yourself in the nose then? I do worse things than that. Like what? Oh, I throwed myself off a house rooftop once, drilled a screw through my palm, three in fact, kicked a bull from behind and paid dearly for it when he got to turning around on me, ummm, this one time I drove myself up north to Niagara Falls and throwed myself over the guard rail but somehow survived the fall.  Another time I went into one a them sweet shops and didn’t stop eating candy until I went into cardiac arrest.  Went into Arby’s and threw myself into one a them fryer pot thingies where they make the fries and oh man, I don’t know, flew over to Japan and tried to be a goddamn sumo wrestler but instead got hospitalized for a year and two months. Ain’t it easier just goin’ on a diet? Tried all them diets.  (pause.)  Cacomorphobia. Who? Cacomorphobia. I have a bad case of fearing the fat man. What in the hell are you— When I was a boy, Jesse Robberson, this giant man boy used to pin me in corners all around the school grounds and sit on my face til I fainted. He’d snuff me out with the bulk of his ass, just like putting out a cigarette. You foolin me? Wish I was. I think you’re full of shit. I ain’t. I think you’re making all this up to justify your violent tendencies. I’m violent because of fat fear. That don’t make no damn sense. I ain’t never heard a such a thing. It do. Look it up if you don’t believe me. You need a therapist is what you need. I know, I ain’t right. You need to talk to some damn doctor about it before you find your dumbass in prison. Already got a record sheet as long as halfway around the globe. They gonna lock you up and throw away the key. Shit, I know it. So go seek help man. I can’t. Why can’t ya? It’s a pride thing. Man, you are one stupid son of a bitch. I have no control over it. Bullshit. It comes over me like a reflex. Jesse Robberson? Let’s go pay him a visit. And do what? Maybe you can kick his ass and cure yo self. I ain’t got a damn thing to say to that man. But maybe if you beat ’em down you’d feel differently. What you doin’? Willo, just tell me how to spell his last name for God sake. Right. Hold on, let me just type in the right county. I have this app locator, find anybody at anytime. Okay. Here! This the guy? BAM!! That can’t be… That’s him, right? Jesus– He is skinny as all hell. I can’t– Yep. All these years…and now he’s a little guy. I think you’re crazy. Sink or swim buddy boy! Swim! Now? Right now. We drive over to his house, knock on the door, drag him out and you squat right on his face til he runs outta air. You’d be cured! I’m telling you! You’d be cured! I ain’t never thought a this before. Let’s go! Shhhh. So mean. Don’t crack your knuckles. I can’t wait to leave. Then leave now. Who’s keeping you? Very funny. You have legs. Walk yourself down the road and wait for your friend to pick you up from there. No. I don’t feel like walking. Cause your lazy. You need to learn how to move in life. I move. I move more than you do. I get up each morning at five-thirty in the morning to go to work. I don’t stop moving until I come home and sit on the couch. So? So, learn to make sense when you talk. I play sports. I play basketball and volleyball and I’m on the track team. You’re on the track team? Yeahhh. How much is that costing me? That’s all you care about. I’m supposed to care about it. Who else is gonna care about it? You? You never come to any of my games. But you suck at all sports, so why waste my time, honey? Yeah but, you’re still supposed to show encouragement and support. Let me break it down to you…I’ve been supporting you since you were born and I am what you call an honest father. I don’t con you like all the other parents. What con? What are you talking about? I don’t make believe you are good at something if you are horrible. So you’re saying I’m horrible? Thanks, Dad. Actually, yeah, that’s exactly what I’m saying. Why don’t you teach me, try to make me better? Because you’re what we call a lost cause, honey. Which means, no matter how hard you try, how much you practice…you’re always gonna suck. You can’t jump, you can’t bend, you have no reach, you tire out, you move like a sloth stuck in glue, you huff and puff and moan…it’s like self-inflicted torture. I can’t see that. Don’t know why you do sports. Well, how do you know all those things if you don’t come and watch me? That’s what MA MA is for. That’s how this family program works. Forget it. Am I lying? Don’t you huff and puff? Your mother showed me a video clip of you on the basketball court. Both teams went back and forth three times, up and down the whole court before you even made it to mid-court when a time-out was called. Can you imagine that? It was like seeing someone go through a series of slow death strokes. You were hot, sticky, flushed and barely able to breathe…like the walking dead. Sports ain’t your thing kid. Well, I’m gonna keep trying. God! Where is she? Taking forever! That’s because you pick friends who are even slower than you. Stop, Dad. I mean it. You asked me a question. Yeah but you don’t need to be so rude all the time. Okay. Were you good at sports? I was the best. What about mom? She was the best, too. So where the hell do I come from? Uncle Charlie. You inherited his genes. That’s disgusting. Yeah well, you win some, you lose some. But I’m smart, right? Smart? You have a functioning brain. That’s as far as we go I’m afraid. I hate you. Not my fault. You and mom made me. I didn’t make me. That’s true. I’m only kidding, sweetheart. You have an intelligent mind. Really? Well, you like history and economics and writing…you still like English class? LOVE English class. There you go. You can’t like all those subjects and not be smart. I get good grades with everything. I know you do. I’m proud of you for that. Are you Dad or are you just saying that? I’m very proud of your grades. Cool. You talking to boys? Don’t ask me that. Make sure when you go out this evening that if there are any boys on the premises that they know to play nice. Yeah, I know. Are there boys gonna be there? Most likely. Any boys you talking to that you like? I can’t believe you’re asking me this. No. I’m not telling you anyway. Just checking. Just be careful. You hear me? Yes, Dad, please. I worry about you. You’re my daughter. I will crush them into the ground if they want to play games. You understand? Yes. Make sure they understand too. I will. I’m not stupid. Okay, okay. Just making sure. Dad, are you going to quit it? I know how boys are? i was a boy once too. They only think with one thing in mind. Girls develop faster so, your emotions are more advanced then some little idiot boy. Yeah. I’m sure you mother informs you of all of this but I just want you to know I know a few things too. I have the boy side perspective and want you to be aware. I’ll shut up now, I don’t want to be annoying. Way past that point, Dad. Right. I’m gonna go wait outside. Okay. Be safe and have fun. If you need me, call me. Okay? Fine. Alright, I love you. Be safe. I will.  Love you, too. Did he now? Not at all, dear. Well, to be perfectly honest, I do believe there appears to be a small question. What small question? Well, do you not find Mr. Bernham acting a bit odd? However do you mean? Strange like. …I don’t believe I’ve noticed anything strange at all. Alright, dear. Perhaps it’s a figment of my imagination but…I happen to be missing a pair of cuff links…the ones given to me on my fiftieth birthday. You must have misplaced them is all. Not quite. I don’t understand. …I caught Mr. Bernham doing a bit of the old snooping around. Did you? When? Where? Well, darling, it happened in the wee hours of yesterday morning. I went to use the toilet when I heard a creak downstairs. I followed suit only to find Mr. Bernham eyeing the Kristofferson painting with a magnifying glass. A magnifying glass? Correct. Just as I was about to utter a word, Mr. Bernham walked into my study and began gently fumbling through my desk draw. No! I give you my word. Well— Shh, not too loud, I don’t want him overhearing if he’s returned. He’s only just— I am concerned not only for whatever it is he is up to but also for the man’s health. Have you noticed that he seems to touch things twice? Twice? Darling, surely you must have caught wind of what appears to be a nervous tick of some sort. This morning he went to grab the tea pot, first touching it with his left hand as if to take hold of it, only to switch over to his right hand to take hold and touching but then only to switch yet again back to his left hand before gripping the tea pot. I also noticed he’ll be walking along only to suddenly stop, take two steps backward and then walk forward again. Can you make any sense out of such behavior? My dear. I did notice something now that I think on it. Do tell. For starters, about two days ago, in the evening I could have sworn I heard a bit of giggling. Giggling? Whatever do you mean? Please don’t tell me he was alone. I’m afraid so. Shocking! Yes, yes it is. Mr. Bernham was in the kitchen by himself when I entered but just prior to my entrance there was an assortment of giggling going on and please forgive me but I could have heard actual banter. This is quite serious. Hmmm. Do you think he made off with my cuff links? One cannot be sure. Let us study his mechanism and observe his looks; We’ll tent him to the quick. If he but blench, we’ll know our course. We will shake a spear for our dear friend over dinner this evening. There is something else. Go on. He was a duck. Darling, please do not tell me that you have gone ill because— No, no. Mr. Bernham was waddling round the courtyard as if he were a duck. And this is the very first time you utter this to me? I was afraid. Afraid of what? That you would think me mad. Who would believe such a thing? But I am your husband. If before this conversation I had told you that I witnessed Mr. Bernham waddling around like a— Bernham: Duck? Hello, Mr. Bernham. Bernham: Meredith, are you alright? I did not mean to startle you. I thought you mentioned duck. Is that what we will be having for dinner, roasted duck perhaps? We were only discussing the possibility of cooking— Bernham: I love duck. Well, I am sure we can arrange it. I will speak with Helena and see if she— Absolutely. I will find out and— Thank you, dear. Bernham: Good show! I fired off two this time. You were gone for so long. I know, I know. I covered as much ground as I could. I found a high spot, further out than I—much further out but I made it there and back in decent time. To the minute. Of course. So, how’s my girl? I had some…not much, but some. Maybe it’s better if you force out the cough. Really belt it out so you can clear some mucus. That’s okay. I can only get so much breath in. Keep those covers on you.  Want some tea? No… gonna try the soup. I’m sorry I forgot my inhaler. Should we try? When I was out traveling upon the ridge. There was a long time when every step I took toward it, seemed to take me further away. As if I was walking backward…so, I started jogging, which was the last thing I wanted to do but the most important decision I believe I made. I kept running and running, kept thinking about you and running and running and I completely zoned out. Suddenly, I found myself standing atop the ridge. You okay? Mmm Hmm. What’s a plucked lobster? You don’t know what a plucked lobster is? That’s a combination of a plucked chicken and a red lobster. Oh. Come on, let me get you back to sitting down. Have your soup. Getting cold. After I get you nice and cozy darling. Nice and cozy. Wrap you up nice and…Barb? BARB?! …I’m here…I’m here…just tired. Let me rest…let me slleepp. Okay…okay, you rest…you rest now and I’m sure a rescue team is on their way. They’ll be here soon. We’ll hear those choppers coming for us way in the distance and it will be the greatest sound— That’s all you need to do to get on my nerves. I’ll go in the other room, forget it. You can come in here but don’t aggravate me. I won’t bother you. Are you kidding me? I told you not to bother me. I’m just eating my food. Can’t I eat? You chew like a camel. Eat silent or go in the other room. Oh my God! I can breathe, I can breathe, I’m— You idiot!  You almost killed me. You are gonna be the death of me yet! I was choking! I told you, you eat like a camel! I was eating silently for you. I need to eat loud, so I don’t choke! Do me favor. Get away from me. Go inside! Get away, as far away as possible and eat as loud as you want! Yeah, well that’s what I’ll do. Make sure you clean up this mess. No reason to hit me with the wiffle ball bat. You took me off guard. Yeah, well you make no sense. That’s what you get for leaving your things around. You don’t invest your time into anything worthwhile.  Everything’s a Youtube party with you bro.  Back up and take into account what it really is you are doing with your life.  All these skits and video uploads are pointless.  What is it adding up to? Dude, I enjoy it. It’s fun. Fun with no direction isn’t cool. Why do I always need to have direction? Can’t I just do something because I’m having a good time doing it? Why does it always have to be so, I don’t know man, so calculated. If you found something you like to do, maybe take it more seriously is what I’m saying. Don’t just do shit to do shit. Right now I’m having a good time and exploring and just having fun with my friends. I’m not really— But that’s the thing man, again, have fun but don’t waste five years doing the same shit without any goals in mind. Like, have a goal, something you wish to reach or get to. Don’t be so random. Right now I’m chilling. If I start getting too serious about my vids then it will get boring. I like being off the cuff man. Who says you still can’t be off the cuff? You’re not hearing me bro. You do this shit to me all the time too man. Whenever—you always get in my grill when I’m into something. I don’t want your advice. Dude, I want to see you be something in your life. You skipped out on college and now your doing these stupid videos everyday. They aren’t stupid videos! What are they then? Videos of you jumping off the garage into the pool and setting your friend Vinny’s ass on fire or what the hell was that video you did with the monkey? Are you insane? Memories and good times. I can always go back and watch them and I like sharing my life with people. Why? Just forget it man, leave me alone alright?  You won’t get it. Get your head out of your ass for once and start looking into what’s next for yourself. Yeah, yeah— Or you’re gonna end up like Dad, a complete disaster, trying a million different things throughout your life and never sticking to something and seeing it through. We’ve talked about this. I thought you understood. I do man but stop being so hard. Give me my space. You have your space but as your brother I’m telling you something because I care. If I didn’t care I wouldn’t say jack. I know. Do your thing bro but give what I’m telling you at least a little thought. Yeah dude I’m good. Don’t brush me off Lonnie. I’m trying to tell you important— Why can’t you trust in me? Let me live my life and trust in who I am. I’m young! I’m not trying to be Mr. Successful all the time like you. I want to live a good life without— Without stress? That’s the thing with you, you don’t take responsibility for nothing. Things get handed to you and you don’t work for them. Your luck will run out and when you don’t know how to hustle and make shit happen, you will have nowhere to go. You need to know how to make it happen bro. You hear me? You will see. What? What will I see? I do work at things, you just don’t understand it and that’s not my problem. When you stop living in your mother’s basement and can pay your own phone bill, maybe then I can take what you’re saying more seriously. Leave. You know I’m right. Get away from me a**hole! It’s good that you get angry. Shows you have a pulse. Use it to be something instead of slouching. Stop being such so lazy. Okay loser. Call me whatever you want. The truth is the truth. Yeah but I’m playing with you though. Doesn’t feel like playing. How long you know me Doogie? Forever. So whatch you sayin’? You get aggressive. Awwww, poor Doogie gettin’ all sad on me. See? That tone right there. It’s like you don’t like me. Course I like you. You’re my best friend. You sure? You on your period? You need to chill. Damn. I’ll leave you alone then. I don’t want to be left alone, I just want to be treated right! Is that so hard for everybody to understand? …What’s up? My brothers beat the shit out of me last night. Like play fighting or for real? For real. Does it hurt? Why those morons always do that to you?! There was no dinner but I saw a chicken cutlet sandwich and some wings in the fridge, so I ate it. It was their food and they kicked my ass. Why didn’t you come by me for dinner? How many times am I going to come over for food? Every day if you want. Yeah, well, I’m hoping I get this job at McDonalds cause then I can eat and get paid. You applied? Yeah. Ain’t that far from where we live? Take my bike. …I feel stupid now. I should already know, right? It’s not your fault Yola. You’re just being you. Maybe I can work with you, get a job at Mickey D’s too. You would suck. Ha ha. Whatch you mean? I can flip burgers better than you any day of the week. I don’t think we need to flip burgers. I think they nuke them, don’t they? Whatever. So, what’s on the menu tonight, I’m starving. Let’s find out. I’m hungry too. Your mom don’t mind me coming over all the time? Hell no. She loves you. I love her cooking. She can open up her own restaurant. Shut up. Just saying. What is that? What? That… What? What is that? I don’t know. What…what the hell is that? Looks… Is that? I can’t make it out but— Is that a belt? That’s what I was just thinking. A belt and a— Yeah. It’s— He’s fu–he’s–is he getting choked? Holy shit. Is he breathing? Look how red his face is. What the hell is in his mouth? Like a, a plum or an apple…piece of fruit?  Is he choking on fruit? No, it’s, it’s one of those rubber balls, I think…see the black belt strap attached to it? He’s not moving. He looks dead. Oh my God. I think someone was choking him. Definitely. But… What? I think he just fainted. I can’t tell if he’s breathing. What the hell was he doing and with who? That was… Yeah. Was he getting it from behind? But that’s Marvin. Did you see the other person at all? No…nothing. Still. Holy shit. Babe, I’m worried. You think he was being— Tortured? I mean, I was able to see his veins in his neck, right? You too? His head was as red as a tomato. Should we call the cops? And say what? We’re spying on our neighbor? But what if we can save his life? What if he’s not breathing? Oh my God. What is that? Someone’s sitting on his face…is that…that’s an ass. Someone’s ass is…they’re wiggling— What the—the ass is bouncing on his head. Call the cops. Wait, wait, wait…let me record this…evidence. I’m coming! No, no, they just got up. What? I can’t see them now. They left the—he’s off the bed now. What was all that? That was—isn’t his wife at work? Shouldn’t he be at work too? You think he’s cheating on— Oh they’re back, they’re back! I don’t know. I don’t know. Can’t make that one out. Wha— Like a piece of equipment— No way! A vacuum?! No—you’re right. He’s— Close the blinds, close the blinds I don’t want to see that. That has to be the most horrendous thing I’ve ever—I can’t even! That’s enough. How am I ever going to look Marvin in the face again? I want to know where his wife is. Babe, the guy’s a freak. He’s a freak who’s cheating on Lauren. Maybe she’s the one sticking in the vacuum. I can’t ever imagine that being her. You have her number? Yeah. Call her. See if she picks up. I’m not calling her. Just call her. And say what? You’re husband has the end of a vacuum hose up his ass? If she answers the phone, we’ll know it’s not her, right? If she doesn’t answer? Odds are fifty-fifty. Okay. That cleaning lady is going to town, huh? Oh no, that’s just Harry.  Sports. Ask her if we can borrow her vacuum cleaner. Harry) Holy shit! That was crazy! Crazy! She has no clue. They must look at us through their window too. Horrible. Freaking spies.  She calls back tell her you see him resting in bed. I’m not going over there. I can’t tell her the truth but I don’t want to lie either. What should we do? Just stay out of it. Stay out of it? You’re the one that made me call! Now we’re in it. No we’re not. If she calls you don’t answer. I have to answer. That isn’t right. Refresher.  The guy has a vacuum cleaner hose up his ass. That’s where I draw the line, okay? Okay, okay, maybe you’re right. We’ll close the blinds and pretend we didn’t see a damn thing.  Out of sight, out of mind. Look at yourself. Come on. Stop it! Will you stop it? Get out of the way! You used to like my music beats. Gross. Yeah, well, I like it. Whyn’t ya go on a diet or something? You smell, too. What I smell like? You smell like a foot been trapped in an arm pit for a week straight. That all you got? Not so bad. You smell like a fish after banging an Indian curry. Oh, come on. That don’t even make no sense. You smell like a corpse that’s been lying dead in a bucket of cigarette ash and beer. Ain’t doing nothing but watchin’ time go by in this boring ass life we be living in. What’s boring about it? We in the country. We got fresh air, countryside views, home cooked meals and a ton of other shit I can’t seem to remember. Exactly. We are one great giant dump. How’s that go? A dump. We a dump. We the excrement that’s been pooped out from some giant creature none of us will ever be able to see. What the hell are you watching online lately? It’s warping your brain girl. It’s true. Ain’t nothing warping my brain. I’m gettin’ smart. It’s time we all start waking up and looking around and seeing that this ain’t it. What ain’t what? This! This whole damn painting we all find ourselves stuck in. I mean, really, don’t this all seem strange to you? This is just how things is, is all. Does it ever cross your mind—I mean, do you ever ponder the what’s and why’s of existence? Oh Bev, I ain’t about to get into science talk…I ain’t your guy for that. I can give a shit less. I wake up, I eat, I work, I sleep…I f’ck. Don’t need to know anything more than that. You’re a sad man. I’m actually a happy man. Life is easy peasy pie darling. The less I know the happier I’ll be. Just let it all unfold. Fine with me. There’s gotta be more. …This is it, kid. Can’t be. I’m afraid so. I want to jump off the Earth. How you gonna go and do that pumpkin pie, your ass is too big? Ha ha. I want to jump off the Earth into the ocean of space and swim wherever I wish to swim. I wanna go as far out as my legs and arms will take me until I drown. Morbid. That’s what I want. Right. Can’t you take me seriously? Ever?? I told you, I don’t wanna— Who cares what you want, Judd? What you want this minute is only gonna be the same as the next. I’m talkin’ about big ideas! I don’t want to settle for this life…I want more, I want more from this life. What more you want girl? You got everything you need right here, don’t ya? …No, I don’t. Well, I guess, shit, I guess we can take a ride in my pick up and go somewhere’s. That’s not it. You ain’t happy. I got that much. I want to be able to do what I imagine, without restriction.
